# What is An Agentic Ai?
Agentic AI is an autonomous artificial intelligence system that can plan, execute, and adapt actions to achieve complex goals without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to prompts, agentic AI systems can understand goals, make decisions about how to achieve them, execute actions autonomously, and monitor results to iterate as needed. These systems use large language models combined with reasoning capabilities to operate independently and adapt to new information.
